# GEOFENCING DJANGO

Currently in offices, attendance is taken manually or by biometric system. Inspite biometric being much effective system, itâ€™s an expensive method. So I am proposing a system based on geofences to record attendance via mobile phone. So for an employee to register for his attendance, He/She needs to be present physically to complete the process.

## Steps
